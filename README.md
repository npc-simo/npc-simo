## Hi there 👋

# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Mohammed Elhajji**, a Web & Mobile Development student at the Higher School of Technology of Nador (EST Nador).

I love building apps, learning new technologies, and improving my skills step by step.  
Currently, I'm exploring **Flutter**, **Laravel**, and **full-stack development**.

I completed an observation internship at **Green Digital IT – GenAI (Casablanca)**, where I discovered the workflow of tech companies, learned HTML/CSS basics, used GitHub, and understood the importance of teamwork and project organization.
